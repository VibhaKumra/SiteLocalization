## Abstract
Antibody binding to cell surface proteins plays a crucial role
in immunity and the location of an epitope can altogether determine
the immunological outcome of a host-target interaction.
Techniques available today for epitope identification are
costly, time-consuming, and unsuited for high-throughput analysis.
Fast and efficient screening of epitope location can be
useful for the development of therapeutic monoclonal antibodies and vaccines.
In the present work, we have developed a method for imaging-based localization
of binding sites on cellular surface proteins.
The cellular morphology typically varies,
and antibodies often bind in a non-homogenous manner, making
traditional particle-averaging strategies challenging for accurate
native antibody localization. Nanometer-scale resolution
is achieved through localization in one dimension, namely the
distance from a bound ligand to a reference surface, by using
topological image averaging. Our results show that this method
is well suited for antibody binding site measurements on native
cell surface morphology.
